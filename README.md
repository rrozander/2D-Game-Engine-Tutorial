# 2D-Game-Engine-Tutorial
## Following a tutorial, made by GamesWithGabe on YouTube, to create a 2D Game Engine in Java. The engine will run a 2D mario game as well as have a level editor. The tutorial can be found [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyKE7vz65rY&list=PLtrSb4XxIVbp8AKuEAlwNXDxr99e3woGE)

__Purpose:__ I am hoping to gain an understanding of how games are programmed. I want to become more comfortable with Java and the various Java libraries, like LWJGL, OpenGL, OpenAL, ect.
